Ungulate Rule: Can someone tell me why the ungulate cards can't have cards placed on them? In a game where every card's placement requirements makes perfect thematic sense, the ungulate rule stands out in having this seemingly arbitrary rule that doesn't fit thematically. I can't see that it's a balance issue - they aren't worth enough points to warrant shutting down a whole column as far as we can tell -and after some test games ignoring the rule, we've decided to to house rule it for all future games that playing on top of an ungulate card is fair game. I'm not looking for validation of our house rule; I'm just having a hard time believing the creators of a game with such a fantastically intuitive, well-integrated theme would have made such a rule for the ungulate cards without having had in mind some thematic rationale behind it, and I'd like to know what that rationale was, or if it is merely a balancing rule or somesuch that I'm undervaluing.
The cards are referred to as "Big Encounters" in the rules, so I guess they are the top of their food chains.
That would make more sense to me if things like the wolf card were treated the same way. As it is, nothing stops me from finding a house in the same location as a wolf.

3 and 4 Player Round Order: I love playing 2 player Meadow, but tried today at 3 player count. I noticed that if you're the 1st player at the beginning, you will also be the 1st player at the middle of the game when all the board is reset (also with the N cards).
So I felt that it was a huge advantage to be the first to chose from the board at the beginning, and then again be the first to chose from a new reset board at the beginning of the 3rd Round (in a 3 player count) or of the 4th Round (in a 4 player count).
Same goes to the huge disadvantage of being the last player...

Is there something that I'm missing out from the rules?

Is this a perceived advantage / disadvantage or do you have enough plays that you can say there is an actual advantage or disadvantage?

Did you see this thread? (I didn't read it, I just saw it in the forums when searching for another thread with this topic).
unfair advantage for 1st player at 3-4 player counts
Thanks for the link. The opinions divide, so I still have the feeling that being able to be the first to chose a card among 16 new cards, twice during the entire game... It's a good advantage.

How does the goal for Big Encounters (Envelope U) work?: Envelope U adds the antler goal and the rule book says, "If you use cards from this envelope, add this token to the other basic goal tokens." Does it mean off to one side, or something? With as big as the N deck is, it's quite likely that no one will see an antler symbol in their game. If you have the antler token among the goals and the symbol doesn't show up in the market, you're effectively playing with two fewer goals. That doesn't seem right, but it's exactly--what happened in our 3-player game tonight.

Edit: this question arose from a dumb mistake on my part--I had neglected to actually shuffle in the cards from Envelope U.
I've always interpreted the rules regarding the Ungulate (Stag's Head) token as straightforward: If you're using the Envelope U cards, add it to the other goal tokens before randomly drawing and placing around the campfire.
As for issues of rarity: I take your point, but I would assume the designer's argument would be "It's the same for everyone", with the likelihood of increased competition for Ungulate cards if/when they come on the market being merely a "feature" of including them. [BTW: note that there is an Ungulate card in Envelope Y (Christmas) as well.]

It's definitely something to consider with lower player counts - particularly 2-player. If you feel it's going to be unbalancing and affect your enjoyment, perhaps leave out some of the other expansion cards to reduce the overall deck, or else house-rule that the token is left out when selecting goals. It's your game after all...

Ungulate. I couldn't for the life of me remember the word I wanted. And now Envelope "U" makes sense. It also makes sense that there's one in the Christmas pack, but we haven't opened it yet. As a result, there is only one of the cards in our deck (currently) and I don't like that, at most, one person can get the bonus when that time is in play. I agree that the directions seem straightforward and it's how we played, but I developed misgivings when I saw how it worked out. Also, I prefer to play by the rules at least once before we go mucking with things. Thank you for your help.

Edit: Well, this is embarrassing. The reason it didn't work for us is that I haven't actually opened Envelope U yet. I planned to after our previous game, but apparently forgot. There is only one ungulate card in the deck because I purchased and added Promo Envelope P a couple of weeks ago and it includes a jackalope. I was looking through the list of cards and see that there are supposed to be 7. That sounds much better. Thank you again.
Less than 3 months to go now before you can open Envelope Y!
I was struggling to remember if the jackalope had the Ungulate icon, but decided to ignore it anyway as it's a promo and I didn't want to assume you had it.

BTW: the official symbol names (at least for the Base Game) are listed here.

Mandatory Special Actions? Play ZERO Cards with Special Action?: Hi,
1) Can you play ZERO cards using the Path Token whose special action reads "Play up to 2 cards from your hand into your meadow and/or surrounding area"?

If not, then it seems as if there are situations in which your inability to play a special action (e.g. you don't have one or two cards to play) will prevent you from placing a bonus token for meeting goals on the bonfire board.

2) Additionally, does anyone know if you HAVE to take these special actions when placing your path token in the notches of the bonfire board? The wording reads as if there is no choice in taking the action or not and I know I will be asked this by a fellow player at some stage.

If not, then it seems as if there are situations in which your inability to play a special action (e.g. you don't have one or two cards to play) will prevent you from placing a bonus token for meeting goals on the bonfire board.
I would say "Yes": I would assume zero cards to be included in "up to 2". It's not compulsory to play a card during normal play on the main board either, so that would be consistent. This would therefore mean you could perform the special action of the "2" path token, albeit in a "null" manner.
I would suggest, though, that this is a bit of an "edge" case, and - as with placing a path token on the bench - it's something to be avoided in practise if possible. The "2" path token has the only special action that allows placing a card, and placing two cards as part of the same action is very powerful, particularly towards the end of the game where you want to play as many cards out of your hand into your meadow as possible.

In the "The Course of the Game" section of the rulebook, the description of the "Player Turn" includes the following:
"Each path token allows you to take 1 or 2 action types, depending on its placement:
- main board - drawing cards and (optionally) playing them in the meadow or surroundings area.
- campfire board - taking a special action and (optionally) fulfilling a goal."

So: drawing cards and special actions are compulsory (which is why the "up to 2" wording is so important, as we both observed above), while playing cards and goals are optional.
Thanks Iain, that's how I interpreted it as written too. I wondered, though, if I had either missed something or if someone were aware of any reasons why it wouldn't be so (like errata, FAQ etc...) which I couldn't find. I always like it when games use words like must or may, but I couldn't find those words in the rulebook for this situation.

As for edge case, maybe it's just my luck, but I've already had a couple or more situations where I was down to my last path token that just happened to be this "Play up to 2 cards" token and wanted to get a goal but didn't have any remaining cards in my hand. So knowing it's ok gives me peace of mind.

Ground card placement: Hi,
On page 8 of the rulebook it states "When playing a ground card, place it on the right or left side of any already played ground cards."

On the back page, in the centre-right panel it states "Place a ground card next to other cards of this type."

In the first case, you build out left or right of your existing meadow's ground cards.
In the second, it sounds plausible to shift card columns to open up space so that two grass cards, for example, can be situated next to one another.

Which rule is correct or am I incorrect in my interpretation somewhere?

I've played it that you add to the left or right of the group (as stated and shown on page 8). Because adjacency can be a requirement, I do not think you can place in between two existing columns. The detailed rule explanation should overrule the summary on the back.

Also, fwiw, the PDF of the rules I have state this: "Place a ground card next to another ground card (max 10)." Not as contradictory as the one you quoted.

Agreed. That text on the back of the rules sounds like a problematic translation or an old version of the game.
Thanks for the replies, Brian and Tahsin. I'll go with that, in that case
Or by "type" they mean ground cards, not the actual particular symbol. The type of card is "Ground Cards", so follow the rules of placement for Ground Cards as described in rule book.

Take a look at the second to left card on the bottom row in this image. It has three requirements - bug, small bird and next to house. So you have to have all three symbols visible in order to play this card, and you have to play it over either the bug or bird as normal, and one of the adjacent columns must have the house.

So if the top symbols on your columns are, in order, bug, small bird, something else, house - you can't play it. If your columns are instead bug, something else, small bird, house - you can play this card on top of the bird.

I don't believe this is quite correct. The "adjacent column" symbol is considered a separate requirement to the others on the card - it's not linked to them.
See Example 7 in the Rulebook which considers the "Chopped Firewood" card. This card has two requirement symbols: a tree, and a house (with adjacency arrows). In the example's illustration, this card can be placed in one of three locations: on top of the tree, on top of the frog (column immediately left of the house), or on top of the berries (column immediately right of the house).
Therefore in your first example of "bug, small bird, 'something else', house", the Dovecote (?) card can be placed on top of the bug, the small bird, or the 'something else'. The only card it cannot be placed on top of is the 'house' symbol.

The only time you must place the card in an adjacent column is when all of its requirement icons have the adjacency arrows. Again from Example 7, the first snapshot shows part of a card which has the requirements house or fence, both with adjacency arrows. In that case, you must have a house or fence icon visible in your meadow, and you place the card on top of one of the columns either side of it.
You must have the symbols required in your meadow (house/fence) to place the card. And then instead of placing the card on top of one of them, as per the normal rules, you must place it in a column to the left or right of one of those symbols instead.

If the card also shows a normal icon, say a worm, you may place directly on top as normal. The left/right requirement only applies to the house/fence.

The example on page 10 does not show that to be the case. In their example you can place the card on either adjacent space or on the non-adjacent matching symbol. They show three valid placements for the card.

Correct. I think Philip was only clarifying that the <House> symbol refers to one of the options when placing the card. He wasn't clarifying the example the others were discussing.
Scenario 1: You're trying to place a card with the <House> requirement symbol.
Requirement: The card MUST be played to the left or right of a stack with the House symbol on the top card.

Scenario 2: You're trying to place a card with the (any other symbol but we'll just use Bird) Bird requirement symbol.
Requirement: You must place the card on top of a stack with the Bird symbol on the top card.

Scenario 3: You're trying to place a card with the <House> requirement symbol and the Bird requirement symbol.
Requirement: You must have both a House and a Bird in your meadow on the top card of your stacks. The card can be placed on top of the Bird card or to the left or right of the card showing a House. You may discard 2 cards to ignore one of these requirements.

I agree with this except for the comments with regards to discarding cards.
As per the "Replacing Missing Symbols" section of the Rulebook (Page 10): "you must always have at least 1 of the required symbols."
In both Scenarios 1 and 2, the card only has one requirement symbol, so you cannot discard cards to ignore it.
In Scenario 3, you may discard 2 cards to ignore one of the requirements, but you cannot ignore both.

card r04: why does this have the landscape symbol twice?
Because you need it twice. There is a PDF file that you can download that has the detailed instructions for all of the cards in the promo pack.

@allbaedoe
not the small symbol i'm talking abt the bigger symbol , also where can i find this pdf ?
  (A Polish version is available too.)
The "R" envelope should also include a card with a QR code and URL on it which both link to the rules sheet: http://rebel.pl/go/meadow.

The rules sheet should be self-explanatory, but R04 represents "Landscape with a fork in the road", so you have two paths leading off from it, both of which are available for play. Hence the two large symbols in separate corners: you can place a discovery card over each of them...

House on a house?: Hello,

1. The requirement to build a house is usually rocks ground, can I play two houses on the same ground?

2. In relation to 1 question, can I play a card with fence icon on top of another card with fence icon if adjacency requirement is fullfiled?

e.g


If fence on the left is played on some ground, can I also play another fence on top of it?

Thank you for your answer.
I say yes to both 1 and 2.

Off the top of my head, the only restriction I'm aware of (base game) is that you can't place anything on top of a card with the Ungulate (deer's head) icon. Of course, not everyone will even have the Ungulates in play (as they are dependent on opening envelopes), so even that restriction may not apply...

2 minor questions: A Landscape card can never have more than one other card (Discovery) placed on top of it, right?

Is there a specific reason why road tokens have to be placed under landscapes? Is it just to prove that you paid the road token? Because I assume the road token could just as easily be paid to the supply.
Larry Schneider
@schnel
A Landscape card can never have more than one other card (Discovery) placed on top of it, right?
Yes, once a Discovery card is played, it covers up the symbols on the Landscape tile so no other card goes directly on top of the Landscape card.

To keep things clear, I imagine, especially since you collect Roads ahead of getting Landscape tiles. There should be more than enough Roads so why the need to toss them back in the supply? Just flip them over and there is no question that you've had enough.

A Landscape card can never have more than one other card (Discovery) placed on top of it, right?
Normally, yes. However there are a few Landscape cards (generally from expansions or promos) that have more than one Landscape symbol. Consider card R04 "Landscape with a fork in the road":

This card has two Landscape Symbols. Playing this card costs two road tokens, but once played you can play two Discovery card on top of it: one covering each Landscape symbol. (See Meadow Cards & Sleeves Pack rules (English).)

Also covered in the Cards and Sleeves Pack rules. To play R05 "Landscape with kites", you need to have at least four Ground cards with the same symbol. For R01 (Brown Bear), you need to have at least 9 Ground cards in your meadow.

"If you are missing a required symbol in your play area, you may
discard any 2 cards from your hand to ignore 1 requirement symbol
of the played card (you can do this multiple times). You cannot
ignore all of the symbols this way – you must always have at least
1 of the required symbols. Place the discarded cards in any order on
the bottom of the corresponding decks"

The rule makes no distinction for Road and Landscape symbols. Therefore all symbols, including those two, are treated the same.
I don't understand.

On page 11 of the rulebook, there is a box that says, "If you are missing a required symbol in your play area, you may discard any 2 cards from your hand to ignore 1 requirement symbol of the played card (you can do this multiple times). You cannot ignore the ROAD symbol this way. Place the discarded cards in any order on the bottom of the corresponding decks.

And on the same page, another box that says, "As with other cards, you can discard any 2 cards from your hand to ignore 1 requirement symbol from the played card (you can do this multiple times). You cannot ignore the LANDSCAPE requirement this way. Place the discarded cards in any order on the bottom of the corresponding decks.

So I'm not sure how you can say that the rule makes no distinction for the Road and Landscape symbols. Or am I misreading these rules somehow?

I believe just once. Each symbol counts as its own individual entity, so if it shows two beetles you have to have two separate beetles showing. You can discard two cards to ignore one beetle but still have to have one of them. You can't discard cards to ignore all symbols on a card.

So can you discard two cards to ignore a ground symbol requirement? I assume so because you have to then place it over one of the other symbols showing in your meadow. Your explanation for why you can't ignore road or landscape icons makes total sense as you wouldn't have a way to place it otherwise, but it seems like you can ignore ground symbols without issue then (as long as there is another symbol required).

Ground cards, example 6, clarification: The rulebook states (emphasis mine):
If 1 of the requirements on the observation card is for a ground symbol, you can play the card directly on top of an empty ground card (you must still fulfill all other requirements) or on another observation card at the top of a column with that ground card at the bottom (regardless of the symbols on the top observation card in this column - see Example 6)

Looking at example 6, it states (emphasis mine):
Will plays the Peacock butterfly card. This card requires the caterpillar and grass symbols. Will may therefore play it on the ground card with the caterpillar symbol or at the top of the column with the grass ground symbol base.

The example then shows that it can be played on the butterfly card that is on top of the stack with a grass ground symbol (fine), or directly on top of the card with the caterpillar symbol, which has a wetlands ground type.

This is unclear to me. It can be read several different ways:
1) You can play a card with a ground requirement on ANY ground card, provided it is directly on it and you have an appropriate ground somewhere, this is implied by "directly on top of an empty ground card", combined with the image of the grass requiring card being placed on the wetland ground card.
2) You can play a card with a ground requirement on ANY ground card, provided it is directly on it and you have an appropriate ground somewhere, AND it has one of the other matching requirements, this is implied by "directly on top of an empty ground card", combined with the example of "on the ground card with the caterpillar symbol.
3) You play observation cards with a ground requirement exactly the same as other observation cards, in that they have to be put on top of one of the matching symbols, but because it's a ground card the ground symbol can have others on top of it rather than being directly underneath.

The most logical to me is option 3, but then the wording and example seem suggestive of the others! Can anyone help?

I read it and have always played it as Option 3. You treat it like any other symbol. They use the term "can" instead of "must" so that implies it is is choice. You can place it directly on a ground card (not must). You can also play it on a column that has other cards over the ground card you need. Example 6 is building off of Example 5 in that you have two choices. You can place it in the column with the ground symbol at the bottom of the stack or the column with the caterpillar.

I think it might be worded this way since ground symbols are the only symbol never to be covered. So they went the extra step to say you can place it directly on top of one (like you you would with other cards) OR place it on one that has ground at the very bottom because the ground symbol is still visible. In other words, you could use that ground symbol indefinitely and for many cards, whereas cards with any other symbol are usually used once (unless the card using them has more than one symbol and covered another card).

Does it mean, you can only place it on a GROUND card with the matching symbol (for example a Tree) or is it also possible, like with other cards, that you can place it on the symbol (for example a treee) on an OBSERVATION card?

Thank you very much for the quick answer. This is unclear in the rules because there is the passus : "Play it on a GROUND card with the matching symbol" not "On a GROUND or OBSERVATION card with the matching symbol".

Where are you seeing that passage? I am don't see it worded that way in my copy of the rules.

Again, I think they are just trying to clarify that since a ground card never gets its ground symbol covered (unlike all the card symbols in the game), you can place it either directly on top of a ground card with that symbol, or on the column with that ground symbol no matter how many other cards are on that column.

You are asking something different than the rest of this thread. You are talking about just the card symbols (a tree in this example) and so it is is already addressed clearly in the rules that it can be place on a card (it doesn't specify between a ground card or other observations cards) as long as the matching symbol is showing.

Is that for my edification to see where Andreas is coming from? If so, thank you.

I feel like Example 6 makes this crystal clear. The card in question needs both a Worm and a Grass. The two options are to place it on the column that has the Grass (which happens to be a ground card as well) because the Grass is elsewhere. OR you can place it on the column that has Grass because the Worm is elsewhere. The rules are all clear on this.

Perhaps it is not that unclear in the English rules. In the German rules example 6 is explained like I said. It says that cards with a ground type and another symbol can only played on a observation card (Beobachtungskarte) in a column with the ground plus you have the other symbol OR you can play it on a ground card (Bodenkarte) with the needed symbol plus you have the needed Ground in another column.
The case that you can play the card on a observation card with the needed symbol is not mentioned here.

Card requirements: I've only just started playing the game,if a card shows ex.3 requirements, do I need to have all 3 requirements on my meadow before I can place it somewhere?or can I have any of the 3?

@Chryssoula
I've only just started playing the game,if a card shows ex.3 requirements, do I need to have all 3 requirements on my meadow before I can place it somewhere?or can I have any of the 3?
You need them all.
From the rules
Card has 1 requirement. You play the card on top of a card
with the required symbol (see Example 4). If you have several
cards that fulfill this requirement, choose 1 of them and place
the card on it.
Card has 2 or more requirements. You play the card on
a chosen card that has any of the required symbols (see
Example 5). All of the required symbols must be visible in
your meadow – only then can you cover 1 of them.
Correct on all accounts, both replies.
When a card has more that a single (one) requirement, you can also discard two cards from your hand to fill in for one (any one) of the requirements.
In your case, you can either meet all three directly as stated; or you can discard two cards and meet only two requirements by the meadow symbols; or you discard four cards to cover two of these and only fulfill one by the meadow. Any combination works.
In short, meeting one of the requirements can also be done by discarding two cards, but at least one requirement should be fulfilled by the meadow (symbols). Meaning, for a card with only one requirement, you cannot discard cards. But yes, all the requirements have to be met on every card, either by meadow or by discarding cards.

How do I get more cards I to my hand?: We start with 5 cards, but somehow I'm down to 1. How do I gain more cards back I to my hand?
The only way to gain more cards in your hand at the end of your turn, is by taking an action that gives you a card, but doesn't play a card.

So pretty much just using the campfire action of the 1 or 3 tile.

Yep, that's the hidden downside of the 'play 2 cards' action - you reduce your options for the remainder of the game unless you later spend a turn not playing a card.

Thanks, I appreciate the clarity. That is pretty brutal when I am just staring at one card in my hand.
Well, hopefully you saw it coming when you went down to 4, then 3, then 2 before.

It's one of the big decision points in the game - when to play an extra card, and when/if to discard extras to compensate for a missing symbol. Painful but powerful.

Yeah. It was my first two plays of the game, so I didn't realize there are no real methods to get the cards back. After you guys chimed in I now know I should be more cautious about burning them up so quick. Thanks!

I really like the game and look forward to a lot more plays. I might just have to think about that new expansion coming out soon. Maybe that will have a method for adding in more cards?

Well, that is a strategy. Mine is not to use the "play two at once" or "pay by cards for resources" until the very last round. Then I flush everything possible from hand, because cards in the hand are not earning points anyway. But until then I keep my options open.
That's a really good strategy to save them for the last round. Thanks!

When you take the "play 2 action" you don't draw a card, so I believe you would be net -2 cards after this action. So you would go straight from 5 to 3, then to 1.

Ground symbol as requirement: If my card has a ground symbol as requirement, can I play the card on top of ANY empty ground card? Or, on the contrary, only on cards of this ground type?
Adalyn
@AdalynIris
If my card has a ground symbol as requirement, can I play the card on top of ANY empty ground card? Or, on the contrary, only on cards of this ground type?
If the ground symbol is the only requirement, you have to play your card on top of a column that starts with that ground (doesn't have to be an empty ground card).
If there are other required symbols, you have to have them all, including the ground symbol, but can play your card in any matching column.
In the second case, in a column matching with one of the symbols? My question is coming from the fact that the rules sounds to me as allowing any ground card, not necessarily matching (see first part of the rule):
“If one of the requirements of the observation card is for a ground symbol, you can play the card directly on top of an empty ground card (you must still fulfill all other requirements) or on another observation card at the top of a column with that ground card at the bottom (regardless of the symbols on the top observation card in this column – see Example 6).”

In the second part "that ground card" is specifying a ground card with the correct symbol. (Otherwise it would say "a ground card" or "any ground card.") It could be worded a bit more clearly but that's obviously the intent.

There are basically three kinds of requirements - symbols (e.g. house or grub), neighboring symbols (e.g. next to a house) and ground symbols (e.g. rocks). A column matches the first kind if it has the required symbol at the top. A column matches the second kind if it is next to one with the required symbol on top. A column matches the third one if it started with the required symbol. And in order to play a card, you must have matching columns for all requirements, and the card must be played on top of any of those matching columns.

So let's say you have a card requiring a bug, rocks and adjacency to a house. Then you must have a column that ends with a bug, a column that starts with rocks and a column that ends with a house. And if you have all that, you can play your card:
a) on any column that ends with a bug, no matter what ground card it started with
b) on any column next to one that ends with a house, no matter what it started with or what's on top of it now
c) on any column that started with rocks, no matter what's on top of it now

My question is: can I play it only on a GROUND Card with the matching symbol (for example a Tree) or can I also play the card on a OBSERVATION Card with the matching symbol (for example a Tree) when I have the needed Ground on another column?
If the card you want to play needs a tree, you can play it on a tree. As long as any other requirements are met somewhere in your tableau.
I hear ya, Adalyn. This rule definitely could have been worded better. I noticed that on at least one review ("Busy Dad"), he read it the way you did. However, in the spirit of the other placement rules, I've always played that in order to place it on an empty ground card, the ground symbols must match. (I also feel that, if it were meant to be interpreted as worded it would have been in bold in the rules, as this would contradict all other placement rules.)
This is by far the best explanation for placement requirements. Kudos to the Karlis!!

Path #4, two cards: Quick question (hopefully!).

When using path token #4 to play two cards, are they supposed to be played simultaneously?
Or can they be played one at a time - so that the symbols on the first can be a requirement for the second?
As I understand, you can always place cards and tokens one at a time and considering immediate fulfillment of a placed card, yes. Also, you may place the bonus token before placing cards, after placing cards, or in between (e.g. after placing one of them).
In short, your first assumption is correct.

Are uncovered requirement symbols in meadow available to fulfill requirements of other cards?: Are the requirement symbols on the uncovered (top level) cards in my meadow available to use to fulfill requirements of card in my hand that I want to play? Or are the large symbol(s) the only available symbols to use when fulfilling requirements of another card?

Example:
Can I play this card (B36) with a tree requirement on top of this fence card which has a tree requirement symbol on it?
No. The card just give you a fence. The other two are the cost to play that card. They don't give any bonus after it is played.

Replacing a Missing Symbol Question: Had an interesting question come up the other day. If I discard 2 cards to be used as the Ground Card for one of the card requirements can I then place that card in its one spot in the Meadow or would it need to cover the cards other requirement? Example I have a card that requires a grub and grass. I have no grass symbols. I used the 2 cards discard for the grass would I have to place the new card on the grub or can I place it on free spot in my meadow.
If I had to guess, I would say the card still has to go on one of the symbols printed on the actual card. It shouldnt matter you used the discard 2 option to actually play it from your hand, it can only be placed on one of the appropriate columns.

You need to cover the card's other requirement - the "grub" symbol in your example. "Example 8" in the "Replacing a Missing Symbol" section of the rules illustrates an example of this.

You always play your card on another in your meadow that has one of the required symbols (with allowances for the "Adjacency" symbol "< >", of course). This is why you cannot ignore all required symbols by discarding cards: you must still be able to match at least one symbol in order to play your card.
It would need to cover the cards other requirement.

Cards with two requirements: I've just picked up the game, and I have to say it's SO beautiful. Looking forward to learning it and playing with my group.

One question, as I was browsing the rules and the cards.
I had the B14 Chapman's Blue. The requirements are a grub and grassland.
I also had a ground card with a grub and grassland.
Do the two requirements on the butterfly have to be on different cards, or will the two symbols on the one card count?
I know I'd have to cover the grub if I placed the card here.

If there is a slash mark, you only need one of the two shown. If no slash mark, you need both. The card has to go in the column of one of the symbols, but the 2nd symbol could be on that same column.
The two symbols on the one card count.

It is very unlikely the symbols will be on both cards anyway. Most cards only have 1 symbol on them.

but will the card go above both of them or will one of them be blank for other cards to use but still flipped over
It only goes above one. The other is still available to use.

Adding all cards from envelopes at once: Dear Joanna,

My question: can we add all cards from all envelopes to the base game at once - will there be any balance issues?
Considering that the cards from the envelopes all seem to be intended to end up in the deck eventually anyway, I don't understand how there could be balance issues by doing this.

The whole point of fun of the envelopes is in opening them gradually - adding an envelope after every few games for a surprise - kind of gives you a little bit of a "Legacy" experience.

If you already spoiled the surprise by going thru all of the envelopes, then you might as well just throw them all in.
Hi Rob, no we didn't open all of the envolopes, just Spring (too long to wait). Will open them gradually. There was no mention of this in the rulebook so I wanted to check with the designers as they are mentioned as "expansions" in the rulebook.

Building on ground card if it's the only requirement.: Must you build directly on a ground card that is the only requirement for that card you wish to build? As in...

If you have a house that requires a rocky ground card but you have a bird on top of that rocky ground card already can you build the house on top of the bird and rocky ground column? I think I made that more confusing through example but I'm gonna leave it there haha.
If it requires only 1 symbol, and that symbol is only in one column, then you need to build in that column. Other cards can also be in that column so it doesn't need to be directly on that card. If that is what you are asking.
Ok thanks! After reading your response I also re read the rules and found it in there on page 9 example six showing you can play onto a column with the ground card requirement even if it has a card on top of it. I read this book 3 times and somehow missed that... Well next game we will play correctly.
Ground symbols remain on your field until the end of the game, so they are available at any time. As others said before me, you may put it on that column but that way you will lose the bird symbol (or whatever it gives). You still get its points.
I usually try to do this with wolf and eagle symbols to make the column available once again (note that deer symbols permanently close the column).

Once played Are the requirement symbols on the LANDSCAPE cards available as symbols you have?: The rules indicate that when you play a discovery card on a landscape card the symbols are still available. Does that man the requirement symbols become available symbols once played?
No. Those are only requirement symbols, thus they never turn into "proper" symbols. Landscapes and souvenirs only give you points but no symbols. However they do not cover any available symbols, either, as they are not placed onto the acquired discovery cards.

Adjacency question: I'm unsure of the rules on this. Say (hypothetically) that a card states that it must be adjacent to a house but also needs a tree? Must it be adjacent to a house or is it OK to place it on a tree that is not adjacent to a house as long as a tree and a house are visible?

The latter: it's OK to place it on a tree.
Example 7 in the rulebook (P10) gives a worked example with the "Chopped Firewood" card: it can be placed in either of the columns adjacent to the house, or on top of the tree (even though it's not adjacent to a house). From the Example's text:
"If, among the requirement symbols, there is a symbol marked with arrows and another symbol without arrows, you must have both symbols in your play area, but you can choose where to place the card."
[Note however that you can ignore one (only) of those two symbol requirements by discarding two cards.]
Thanks very much for clearing that up! I was overthinking a simple rule.
It’s ok, i came to this forum for the same reason, just now grasping… it’s like a placement advantage.
Exactly the point I was missing. You have an additional choice as to where you play the card.

Goal tokens: In Rahdo's runthrough of Meadow he kept saying that when he placed a goal token between the (say) critter and the butterfly icon, he couldnt cover those icons up in his meadow anymore, since I assume he means that the goal token gets removed again that way?

I can't find any clarification about it in the rulebook. It says you can claim a goal as soon as you see both of the icons present in your meadow (and after placing a token in the campfire ofc). But my question is: does it stay there even if i cover up the goal icons again?
Did you turn on the Klingon subtitles to see if he corrected himself?

I don't recall any rule saying icons must remain exposed.

Rahdo is wrong. The rules even say you can choose the order if you are claiming a goal and playing a card this round (like when you use the #4 tag) because you might have the icons exposed before you play your card and can claim it and then it is gone when you play the card. You never remove the goals once you accomplish them.

When taking the special action with the number
4 or ? path token (if ? copies the action of the

before or after playing your first or second card.
This order matters because you are changing the tableau state with each card. So you jump in when you need to, in order to claim the goal. As the card play may change the tableau, it would state here that you lose a goal if you lose those icons, if that were in fact a feature of the game.
Thanks all! To me it's still not thát obvious, but I'll play it like that! Rahdo obviously usually has prototypes of games and sometimes rules vary by the time the game hits the stores, but I just like seeing him play stuff

Red Cross Symbol on Deer Icon: There’s a question on Facebook about a red cross symbol being displayed over a deer icon. The card isn’t from Envelope U but I think that’s what it’s referring to:

- That a card cannot be placed on top of it.

Is that right?
Yes, I understood it that way too. This card will be the "top of the food chain", so to speak. No other card can be played on top of it.

Yes.
I presume the card in question is the Reindeer (Y3) from envelope Y. The deer icon is for the ungulates, and - as you imply - they are properly introduced with envelope U. You follow the same special instructions as described in the "Envelopes" section of the rules for envelope U, so yes: you cannot place a card on top of a card with the deer icon.
So if your first games were on Christmas Day and you followed the instructions in the rules and added the correct envelope, you might end up in this situation!

2 cards used as wild: To what extent can it be used? Is there an icon it cannot replace? Is there still a minimum requirement that needs to be covered with actual icons?

Symbol with arrows: If I want to play e.g. card with tree and house with arrows, can I play that card in a any column next to the house or card next to house must have also tree symbol ? Or card wit tree can by placed anywhere.

If I understand you correctly, you could place it either on a card with a tree or next to a house. You can also look at page 10 in the rules, there's an explanation for that exactly as I wrote you.

One unplaceable card, only path token #4 left, main board full: Tried Meadow for the first time on a borrowed friend's copy last night. Wasn't excited, but definitely engaged, très accessible. Had a Wingspan vibe, which explains the rating.

That said, ran into a predicament with the following scenario for a player during the 4p game:
* One card left, unplayable into their meadow.
* Main board is full, nowhere to place their only path token left, #4.
* Can't play at the campsite because notch for #4 requires playing two cards (can't even play one) and bench requires playing one card (same).

The rules don't say "may" or "can" or anything else suggestive of optional for the #4 action, such that taking no action didn't seem to be a choice. We ended up house-ruling that they could place the path token at the campsite and take one card off the top of one of the active deck of their choice.

What's the proper answer to this situation?

What's the proper answer to this situation?
My take:
1) From the rules, the text for the #4 Special action is "Play up to 2 cards from your hand into your meadow and/or surroundings area.".
Now "up to 2 cards" includes playing zero cards, so this is a valid option.

2) Also from the rules for placing a path token on the bench: "Doing this allows you to play 1 card in your meadow or surroundings area.".
"Allows" does not mean "forces". Playing a card on the bench is therefore also a valid option.

Taking the special action is arguably the best option in this case. You don't say if the player in question was able to fulfil a goal (and I'm assuming they couldn't), but the option to do so when performing a special action would still be valid even when playing "0" cards as above, whereas it's not an option if you place the token on the bench.
Thank you! We all took turns poring over the rulebook and none of us spotted those.

What if there is no card to lay?: What happens if you have no cards you can lay, and no cards on the board will work, and even if you pick 3, you still can't lay a card? Are you forced to use your other cards as wild so you could possibly lay one, or can you skip laying a card that turn?
You never have to play a card. If you take from the board, you have the option to play a card into your meadow. If you can't, your turn ends.
Worth noting that if you use a fence post for the pick 3 option, you cannot also play a card in the same turn.
Denis Yanishevskiy
@Dkaratekid

I assume you are referring to use of a path token on the campfire board? If so, the only time you can play on the campfire board and also play a card into your meadow are:
-if you use the path token 4 and play two cards into your meadow
-place any path token on a campfire board bench and play one card into your meadow.
Path tokens 1, 2 and 3 do not allow playing into your meadow on that turn.
You can always take and play a ground card.
@Dominikach
You can always take and play a ground card.
If you are below the 10 ground card limit, agreed!
@Dominikach
You can always take and play a ground card.
I can interprete this in two ways:
If you mean getting and playing a ground card is often a decent alternative that may get you long term value: warmly agreed.

But I disagree with the word 'always' if that means it is always an option. Ground cards can be blocked by path tokens. The last two turns of a round it is very possible that you don't have the matching path tokens to get to a ground card. There is no rule that guarantees acces to them.

Choice of a requirement - 1 of 3: Hi to all,

For B34 observation card I need to fulfill 1 of 3 requirement (presented symbols)?

Tnx.
There are 4 different symbols but separated into groups of two. So for the top you have to have a paw or a bird. And for the other you need either a bug or a frog. So it’s two different requirements from 4 possible options
There are 2 requirements for the card. The upper one is either a paw or a bird, the lower one is either a bug or a frog.
Hi!

You need to fullfill 2 symbols:
1. Choose between mammal or bird
2. Choose between insect or batracian

The slash is between two symbols not three. See page 9 of the rules:
If the requirement symbols are divided with a slash, it
means that you need only 1 out of 2 presented symbols
to fulfill the requirement. You decide which symbol to
choose. For game purposes, a choice requirement only
counts as one symbol (not two).
Surely you need 3 symbols; a frog; a paw or a bird; a bug or [another] frog.
Jake you get a Frog symbol if you are able to provide two icons, one each from the two smaller symbol pairs.
Jake Prescott
@jakeprescott
Surely you need 3 symbols; a frog; a paw or a bird; a bug or [another] frog.
The big icon is not a cost; that is what the card provides once it is in your Meadow. Only the small icons underneath are costs (in this case, as others have said, it is two sets of two possible costs).

For reference: in the terminology of the rules, the big icon (a frog, or "Cold-blooded", in the case of B34) is the "card symbol", and the small icons are the "requirement symbols".

Road tokens - limited supply?: Is the number of available road tokens limited to the supply that comes with the game (28 total)? We assumed so but could not locate it clearly stated in the rules.
You can have as many road tokens as you can manage to get. I've never had more than like 7 (I think).
My guess is that the supply is limited to what is in the box. I have never seen this supply to be exhausted.
I think it would be virtually impossible to exhaust it. Especially if you had any interest in scoring points during the game.
Folks, it is possible and I have seen it happen, yesterday during a 4-player game at Dice Tower West. Maybe not the ideal strategy, but it can happen; this is not a hypothetical question.
Wow! You actually ran out of road tokens?
Yup. And one of the players was pissed because he had been collecting high-value landscapes, leading us to the debate about limited vs. unlimited supply . . . .

It will be very hard to use all of them as it will need strategy that isn't a winning one

Rowan Card B28 Clarification: The Rowan card (Index B28) has two ending symbols at top left: a tree icon and berries. They are side-by-side without a slash between them.
So presumably this single card could be used for these use cases:
A. to fulfill a campfire seat where one requirement is a tree and the other is berries, and also
B. fulfilling both requirements (trees and berries) for another card. For example, if a landscape or animal required a tree, berries, and an insect, the single Rowan would meet two of those reqs and you would just need another card to meet the insect req

Correct? Rulebook doesn't cover cards with multiple top left end symbols that I could find, and a search here and on Google didn't turn up anything.

Correct on both counts. Once you've played B28, both of its symbols are "visible in your meadow", and that's all that matters to fulfil requirements. The fact that they're on the same card is irrelevant.
Thanks so much!

Question about placing a card.: If I have card b15 for example. It requires a grub and grass. Can that be played directly to the starter card that contains those since both symbols are technically visible?

Thanks!
Patrick Kenny
@Px316xK
If I have card b15 for example. It requires a grub and grass. Can that be played directly to the starter card that contains those since both symbols are technically visible?
Yes: until a card's been played on top of it, either or both icons on the Ground card can be used to fulfil requirements. Once a card (say B15) has been placed on top, only the Ground symbol of the Ground card can still be used (as it's never covered).

Question on requirements.: When looking for the needed requirement symbols to lay a card in your meadow, do you only look at the large card symbols in the left hand corner, or can you also look at the smaller requirement symbols on the card? Do any symbols on the card count as a requirement?
Barb Mazzocca
@potchie

No, the requirement symbols are ONLY the small ones. The large one is the one you "get" once you played the card in your meadow.
I mean the cards in the meadow. If I have a card in the meadow with a large grub, and the small picture of a beetle and the card I want to lay in the meadow needs a grub and a beetle as the requirement, can I use both the large symbol of the grub and the small symbol of the beetle on the card to meet the requirement, or do I have to only use the large symbols on the cards that are already in the meadow to meet the requirements on the new card I want to place. In other words, are the large symbols and small symbols visible in the meadow able to be used to meet the requirements on the new card I want to lay.
Once a card is placed in your meadow, only its large symbol (known as the "Card Symbol") is used to meet the requirements of new cards that you are trying to place in the meadow, (The exception is with Ground Cards, where its "Ground Symbol" can also be considered when placing new cards.)
The small symbols are the "Requirement Symbols", and they are only used to decide where in the meadow that particular card can be placed.
In other words, the Requirement Symbols (only) of the card you're trying to play have to match with Card and Ground Symbols (only) on the cards already in the meadow.
(I hope that all makes sense...)
Yes that makes sense! Thank you!

Something Very Basic I think I need Clarified.: I imagine this will be a dumb question but I am not 100% sure so I will ask: with an observation card, I understand you have to have the required symbol(s) visible in your Meadow to play it but do you have to play it on top of one of those symbols or can you play it anywhere in your Meadow? I believe you must cover one of those Symbols with the card when you play it but I am not sure. Thanks.
You must have the icons shown in order to play it, and yes, it must be placed on one of those icons when played. Please note, there are some cards that must be played adjacent to one of those icons, I believe they show up on the fence and building icons (they will have << or >> to show 'in a column next to' this icon).
Hi Scott. Yes it must be placed on top of a base environment or subsequent card depicting at least one of it's requirements. There is an easy to miss rule that lets you discard two irrelevant cards from your hand to serve as fulfilling one of the required icons that you do not already have in your tableau, but the placed card must still go on the other icon. In the case where three requirements must be met you could discard four cards to ignore two of the three requirement as long as you have the third icon in your tableau and place the new card atop it. That's not very efficient play of course, but allowed.
Also, if you have a card that requires a road token, as well as other symbols, it can only be played on a road. Whenever there’s a road token requirement, it must be played on an open road token.
Thanks everyone for clarifying. I was pretty sure this was the rule but had seem something in a how to play that made me question if it was the case.

2p campfire bonus points - too strong?: Hi all,

I have played a handful of games of this all at the 2player count and one thing I have noticed is whomever gets the 4 point bonus at the campfire wins the game.

It seems impossible to overcome the 4 point margin from the camp fire bonus. Considering we both have the same number of actions and access to essentially the same pool of cards (2p there is very little cycling of the card pool)


In my plays I have tried the following:
-play very few or no 1 point observations
-play less ground cards
But as long as my opponent doesn't make bad life choices (ie picking low point cards) our score are very even till the campfire bonuses.
Well, I feel like there's little you can do to improve your score once you "get it". If all players have the same experience, it's likely they'll get very similar scores. I think it's not good gameplay wise, and I hope the expansion will fix that.
In our experience that was the case, indeed. I described that here. . Getting points is very balanced, without any OP
cards or something like that. The campfire can make a swing though. But as you can see in the reactions, there are other experiences. And meanwhile we played a lot more ourselves and actually got winners without the 2, 3 and 4 on the campfire board. So there's hope for you too. Cheers!
Not only is that not true, we have played many 2P games where the winner scored zero points on the campfire board while their opponent received 5 or 9 pts and still lost. The key to scoring high lies in getting as many 4pt cards into your tableau as possible in combination with many 6pt roads. You'll be able to do that more efficiently than your opponent when you are not wasting action tiles on the bonus board and the margin of victory can easily overcome their campfire bonuses. Of course it makes sense to utilize the campfire board when you have no good option in the card market, but only when the action is needed (i.e. earn more roads) and you simultaneously can achieve a bonus fortuitously. I actually feel the campfire bonuses are too weak. You have to spend many more actions chasing specific icons to earn a max 9 pts than it takes to earn as many points just completing card chains. If you max out your tableau with ten environment cards in the first half of the game you'll easily be able to add multiple 4 pt cards when the North deck comes out and obliterate the campfire strategy. Try it, it works.
It can work, yes. If you're able to play all those available 4 pointers, which is possible for all players of course. But the very strong bonus of playing two cards in one turn via the 4 or the ? fiche on the campfire ánd getting the extra 4 point token at the same time is very strong and just for you. You can empty your hand with it in the end, with all your points on the table. I won't say those tokens are too strong, but they sure can make your game and break your opponent.
It definitely puts you at a disadvantage when then happens, but I’ve still managed to pull off a win. I did it by focusing on roads.

How Many Road Tokens?: I can't seem to find it in the rule book. I know you can have up to 10 ground cards, but how many road tokens can you have? We've been assuming that it's 10, but does anyone know for sure?
You start the game with one, but I don't think there is a max limit.

@RedFootClan

There is no limit for road tokens.
Through the game you will be able to get max 24 (in 1-, 2-, 3-player game) or 16 (in 4-player game) road tokens if you use all your 2 and ? patch tokens every turn to get road tokens. So that's the limit, but doing this is not a good strategy
Thank you!!! The most I’ve managed to get so far is like 5-7. It was the only way I managed to win that game because the person I was playing against got all the bonus points, and I got none, so I started focusing on roads, and got really lucky with the cards showing up!
Yep roads are a really good strategy when the others don't do it ;-)

Hi I got a card with a SINGLE requirement. Can I use that discard 2 cards thing?: After which I place this card over another random card ?
Edwin Hwang
@waferjuice
After which I place this card over another random card ?
I don’t believe that’s a legal move - you can’t completely ignore all costs on a card

Per the rulebook:
You cannot ignore all of the symbols this way – you must always have at least 1 of the required symbols
No, you can only skip all but one of a card's requirements - and probably for exactly that reason.

Edit:
Thanks
Correct, you can't ignore a single requirement on a card by discarding two cards as it wouldn't be tied to any existing cards in your tableau. You can reduce the cost of two or three requirement cards by discarding two cards per missing symbol in your tableau since you can then attach it to one of the remaining requirements available on your habitats.

4 player match: Good night guys...

I played Meadow today in 4 players... And some things happened that raised doubts.

There was no space to place the action tiles on the main board or on the fire pit. Then there's only the space left in the bank where we can play a card.
However, sometimes, the player couldn't play any cards because he didn't have the necessary requirements. If so, what to do?

Thanks..

Hi Allessandro,
In a 4 player game there are 4x4 = 16 action tiles in the game, so there should always be a free space on mainboard or campfireboard. May be not always as useful as you want, but still. Remember that you won't be using the "?" tiles in 4 player games.
Besides that: if playing card is an option, it's not mandatory, so not playing a card is possible.

Just to reinforce, so even if I put the token in the Bank, where I can play a card, I don't have to play the card.. Is that correct??

rules page 7, player turn:

"drawing cards and (optionally) playing them in the meadow or surroundings area"
Wow, i just wanted to open the same topic... coz we did run out of cards from S and N, and some players had completely broken chains. I couldn't play only play a 5-6 cards in the second half of the game.

Problem: we used the "?" tile!!! That's 32 extra actions... that would answer all the "short" comings in the cards.

Brown bear r01: Does it require 9 ground cards or ground icons?
Rules say cards, but I wanted to be sure.
Iconography clearly suggests still something else - 9 black icons. We played like that to avoid confusion. Similarly to one of one of the 4 point landscape.
For those who don't know, the rules for the "R" envelope can be found here.
I think it's clear from the rules for R01 ("Brown bear") that you need to have at least 9 ground cards in your meadow in order to play it. (Remember that the maximum number of ground cards allowed is 10.)
From the text "The card can be played on any of them (according to the standard rules).", my understanding is that you play the bear at the top of one of these columns, just as you would if you were matching its ground symbol base.

For R05 ("Landscape with kites"), you need to have at least 4 ground cards in your meadow which all have the same ground symbol, e.g. 4 "Wetlands" symbols.
As rules say: In order to play this card in your meadow area, you need to have at least 9 ground cards.
So 9 ground cards are needed to play the Brown bear

Some Rules Questions: I don't have my copy yet but have some questions after reading the rules and watching a few videos:

1. A Landscape card requires a road and other than the one you start with, you only get new roads using the token action for a max of three (or five if you use the wildcard action for two more roads). Is this correct?

2. You can only have one Discovery on each Landscape card because it covers the required symbol and you can't discard two cards to ignore this icon correct?

3. If an observation card has an either/or icon and you discard two cards does it allow you to ignore both icons when placing?

4. If a card has an adjacency requirement and you discard two to ignore that icon do you also ignore the adjacency requirement?

Thanks!
My thoughts, although I should probably let the experts answer.

1) In the first round you have the one you start with, and then could use your roads action and your wildcard if you chose (as you said). But you can do this each round, so could end the game with many more roads than you could probably actually use if you continued to use the actions that way.

2) The rules specifically say that you cannot ignore the road symbol by discarding two cards. You can ignore the other symbols on the card, but will always need to provide a road for each landscape.

3) It's my impression that you always need to fulfill at least one symbol. So if the card had ONLY a "bug or tree" either/or symbol without any other symbols, you couldn't use the discards to substitute for it. Although if it had the "bug or tree" either/or symbol and another symbol, you could discard two cards and use them for a bug, a tree, or whatever the third symbol was. But you'd need to have at least one actual icon available.

4) I don't believe you ignore the adjacency requirement when using the discards to substitute for the icon.

I believe you are correct in all points except (4).
The thing to bear in mind here is that - as you say in point (3) - you must fulfil at least one symbol. If your card only has one symbol - say, adjacent house - you cannot discard cards to ignore it. If your card has two or more icons, then you can discard cards to ignore all but one of them. So let's say your card has the flower and adjacent house icons: you discard two cards to ignore the house icon, leaving the flower - which you must acknowledge by placing your card on top of a flower in your meadow. The adjacency symbol falls out of the equation the moment the house icon is ignored.
If instead you discarded two cards to ignore the flower icon, you'd have to place your card adjacent to a house.

2. You can only have one Discovery on each Landscape card because it covers the required symbol and you can't discard two cards to ignore this icon correct?
It is correct to say that you cannot discard cards to ignore Landscape icons or (as Rick points out above) road icons,
However: when you say " You can only have one Discovery on each Landscape card because it covers the required symbol", this is only partially correct.

All Landscape cards in the base game have only one Landscape icon, so you can only play one Discovery card on top of it. However in the "R" envelope (which comes with the  ) there is the R04 "Landscape with a fork in the road" Landscape card. (See here). This card has two Landscape icons, so you can play two Discovery cards on it: one on each Landscape icon. Note however that you need to pay two road tokens to play the card, so it's equivalent to playing two Landscape cards at the same time - which feels thematically right for a "fork in the road"...
In other words: rather than playing one Discovery card per Landscape card, you're really playing one Discovery card per Landscape icon.

3. If an observation card has an either/or icon and you discard two cards does it allow you to ignore both icons when placing?

Benches in 2-player game: Hi! I do not understand at all why the benches should be needed in a 2-player game. The main board offers 12 slots for 10 path tokens. Enough space to earn 1 new card before playing one - up to 5 cards per round. Definitlely the better choice instead of only playing a card during a turn in order to hold one less. So are the benches useless here or am I missing anything?
Thanks for help...
Hmmm. You might be playing with the wrong board. the 2-player board only has 5 slots in the edge of the board and you're supposed to be filling in 2 of them with the meadow spacers... there's only 3 spots for your arrows. The board you're using should only have space for 5 goal tokens. Is that what you've been playing with? To be clear, even at 2 players, I don't think we've ever ended up using the benches.
hi, seems you misunderstood my question: the MAIN board has 12 slots, right? so why placing a counter on a bench?
Only possible reason to use a bench I can think of is when you don't want to change any card from board because it could help your opponent. But I think the real reason why benches are there is graphical.
If I remember it correctly I have once had to use a bench in a 2-player game, because all the slots at the campfire board were taken and I didn't have a number left which could reach a card on the main board (and I didn't have my wild arrow left either).

You had no number to reach a card on the main board? How should that be possible in a 2-player game?

Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I had only one option and it was a card I had definitely no use for. I can't remember it right now.
There have been a few discussions about the bench on the 2-player board since the game came out, e.g.  .

Bottom-line is that you shouldn't need to use the bench in a 2-player game. The reason it was kept in the design was a combination of aesthetics and a desire to keep the rules simple.

You should always take the card even if you dont need it. Remember that you can discard 2 cards to cover a symbol you do not have. Therefore... benches are useless in a 2-player game.
Hello,

I think you can do this action just to taunt the other player .

Some doubts: Good morning... A few more questions about Meadow that were raised...

1 - When I discard cards for some reason, do the cards leave the game or do I put them at the bottom of the deck?

2 - The action of discarding 2 cards to supply one of the symbols on the card, how many times can I do? If I have 2 symbols on the card, can I discard 4 cards to supply the 2 symbols?

3 - When the card has an arrow indicating adjacencia, do I have to lower the card next to that symbol? Let's assume that the card requires a flower and has a fence/house and an adjacent arrow. Can I download the card where there is a flower or do I have to drop it next to a fence/house?

thanks

1 - They go to the bottom of their respective decks. See the "Replacing a Missing Symbol" section on p10 of the rules. The same goes for cards discarded during the #3 Special Action.

2 - You can discard multiple times to replace multiple symbols, however the restriction is that you must still have one required symbol. So in your example your card has two symbols so you could only replace one of them. If the card has three symbols, then you could discard 4 cards to replace two of them.
Also note there are some restrictions as to what symbols you can replace, e.g. you cannot replace the "landscape" or "road" symbols.

3 - Either: your choice. In your example, you must have a flower, and a fence and/or house, in your meadow (although you could replace one of them as above). However when placing the card, you can place it on top of the flower, or adjacent to the fence or house. See the "Required Adjacent Columns" section on p10 of the rules.

Can you also discard cards to replace a ground requirement? For some reason, our group tends to discard only for black symbols, not grounds.

There's nothing in the rules that explicitly prevents it, so yes: you can ignore a required ground symbol by discarding cards. The only exception is the general rule that you cannot ignore all required symbols: you must match at least one of them. So say you want to play the Blueberry card (B30) which requires two Litterfall ground symbols: you must have one Litterfall icon in your meadow, but you can ignore the second by discarding two cards.

Fout in spelregels (mistake in Dutch rulebook): In de NL spelregels staat een fout op pagina 12. Het wandelfiche met ? wordt juist Gebruikt in een spel met 2-3 spelers (woord niet moet weg volgens Engelse rulebook)

On page 12 of the Dutch rulebook the word ‘niet’ should be removed (‘dit wandelfishe wordt GEBRUIKT in een spel met 2 of 3 spelers)
Hi Irma,
thanks for pointing that out - we will be revising Dutch rule book to make sure it is correct. Sorry for the inconvenience!
You're correct. I was the one who translated the rulebook from French into Dutch, so I apologize for the slight (yet important!) oversight. It was probably caused because I went over the French negation "n'est" too fast in the following sentence:

"Ce pion Chemin n’est utilisé que dans les parties à 2 ou 3 joueurs."

Which actually means that the token is used exclusively in 2 or 3 player games. The Dutch sentence should be changed from:

"Dit Wandelfiche wordt niet gebruikt in een spel met 2 of 3 spelers."
to
"Dit Wandelfiche wordt uitsluitend gebruikt in een spel met 2 of 3 spelers."
The Geeky Pen
@whipy
"Dit Wandelfiche wordt niet gebruikt in een spel met 2 of 3 spelers."
to
"Dit Wandelfiche wordt uitsluitend gebruikt in een spel met 2 of 3 spelers."
"Dit Wandelfiche wordt uitsluitend gebruikt in een spel met 2 of 3 spelers." => volledig = “1, 2 of 3 spelers”

Of makkelijker wellicht:
“Dit Wandelfiche wordt niet gebruikt in een spel met 4 spelers"

Initial Solo Card: Good morning everyone. A question about the initial solo card.

At what point do I define which side I will drop the card?
Do we first build our starting hand by drawing the 5 cards and then decide on the side of the ground card or do we first draw the starting card and then draw the 5 cards?

Same as multiplayer:

Before the 1st round, but after taking the card rows, each player
chooses a side of their starting ground card and places the card in
their meadow area – with the chosen side face up – as their first card.

Actions of the campfire and goals campfire: Good morning, I have some questions about the actions of the campfire.

1 - When I put my marker on the campfire, do I have to do the action right away or can I do it anytime in that round?

2 - About the objectives, can I fulfill using any special action or just buying cards? For example, I use the token to buy two roads. Can I fulfill one of the campfire's goals? and can i accomplish more than one objective in a round?

Thanks

Morning,
as per rules:
1) you do the action right away, same as with the normal path token, you immediately take a card
2) you can fulfill a goal after placing a path token in one of the notches on the campfire board (any action) and you can place only one per turn
these are things based on rules pg. 12 and 13.

Bench: What it the point of playing your token on a bench? It allows you to play a card. Is this in addition to playing the usual card on your turn so effectively it allows you to play two cards?
The rulebook states that it allows one to play a card when circumstances would not allow it. You are not playing a second card because you don't play a card when you use the campground board unless you choose the option that allows you to play two cards in a turn. Personally, I haven't seen a situation occur when the benches would be used, but I'm sure they added that bit for a reason. Probably have to go deep meta. ;7
If you're playing a 4-player game, there are 16 tokens but only 12 notches on the main board. If all notches are occupied and you've already spent the token whose special ability is to play cards (I forget which number that was), the only way to play a card is the bench.

Also potentially in a 3-player game, where there are a total of 15 tokens in play.
IIRC, it's the "4" token (and in a 3-player game, the "?" token which can be used as a "4") which is the only one to allow you to play a card: if you've already used that, then the bench provides an additional option. I cannot think of any situation where you would be forced to use the bench (i.e. have no other legal option), but there will be times when it's the "best" (or "least-worst") option, such as the last turn of the last round, where you just want to clear cards out of your hand.

There still isn't any reason for the bench in a 2-player game. My understanding is the decision to keep it on all the boards was partly aesthetic, and partly to keep the rules simple. Apparently there's been some discussion about changing it in a future print run...

That explains why I haven't seen its usefulness. I've only played two player and we both looked at the bench and wondered if maybe the view was somehow better there. ;7

That's correct! Also we decided to keep benches for all boards to simple the rules and keep aesthetics
Ah that makes sense thanks for this clarification. I thought perhaps the bench example on page 12 implied that the bench card could ignore the usual placement rules.
A bit late to the discussion as we have only just purchased a copy of the game. Like all of the above my wife and I also could not see the purpose of the benches in a two player game.
I also understood the example rules to mean no placement rules applied, but then that would make the bench very powerful.
As there doesn't appear to be a purpose for the bench in a two player game and very little usefulness in a three player game then, perhaps, the bench could have an additional use...
a player can either play a card from their hand or, take a card into their hand from the top of any one of the three card decks in play.
This house rule would help solve one slight issue I have with the game which is, if you chose to use two cards to negate a placement requirement on a card, it is very difficult to build back your hand size. This is also true with the Path Token #4 which allows you to play two cards.
Any thoughts?

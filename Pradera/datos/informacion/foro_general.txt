Missed card packs ?: Hello everyone

After checking my collection, I do not find some packs.
I have not got the card envelopes from E to L and V.
Do they exist ?

Thanks for every information about them
Have a nice day
Hi,

Two years ago, I have created an excel file with all cards from base game, extensions and promos cards.
You will find it here.
The cards from Meadow adventure book are missing (M01 to M74 cards), but this should be complete.
There is no index from E to L cards, nor V cards.
Thanks for your answer.

All content in one box?: Is there any insert to fit the base game and both expansions in one box? (I don't have the adventure box, only base + downstream fitting in the base box).
It's not possible without serious lid lift. I don't even think it's possible to fit everything in the base game box when ditching the base game insert and the individual scenario storage boxes in the Adventure Book expansion and just using baggies.
Base + adventure book into the base box is possible without lift if you're willing to skip on the storage boxes from adventure book. You can forget about fitting in downstream as well - believe me, I tried!
@rebelstudio. Will there be a bigbox in the future. For All content of meadow in one Box?

No hand limits with cards? No road tokens limits?: Is this game no neither hand size limit and road tokens limit per player? Thanks.
There is no limit to the number of cards or road tokens you can hold.
And there is no limit because if you are holding things in this game you are not scoring, which means you cannot win.

New microbadges: I made some microbadges for Meadow:

Where can I find the info on what the Card Packs represent?: We own Meadow + Meadow Cards Pack + Downstream + Downstream Cards Pack.
Both Meadow and Downstream have Card Index booklets, where each card has the following things listed:
card label --- common name --- Latin name --- interesting fact
For example:
B13 --- European rabbit --- Oryctolagus cuniculus --- Rabbits dig underground tunnels where they nest and hide from threats.

However, Meadow Cards Pack (6) and Downstream Cards Pack (3) do not have an index on the nine cards they add to the game.
Is there any official or unofficial index for those cards?

EDIT 1:
I found the official rules for Meadow Cards Pack on BGG. If features all card labels, all common names, no Latin names (only brown bear needs one, which is Ursus arctos), and no interesting facts.

EDIT 2:
It seems the official rules for Downstream Cards Pack were recently added to BGG.

Not Using Expansion: Hey everyone,

Just a quick question: is it easy to not use the expansion once you’ve added it in?

We’re going to be teaching a new player the game and didn’t want to overload them with the expansion. Do I need to remove any cards now that we’ve kind of combined everything?
There are a few cards with fish, oars and monuments in the main deck. You can probably just discard them and re-draw if they pop up. When the new player draws a face-down card, you may want to remind them to check for fish, oars and monuments too.

Ah, more than just the fish. Okay, I’ll just go through the decks and pull those out. Thanks for the info!

If anyone is looking for this info later, we searched through the 4 decks (N, E, S, W) and pulled 3 cards from each that either showed a fish or monument (triangle) icon. We took out cards that had an oar in the bottom left and we also removed any cards that showed the river ground icon. Totalled 3 cards per deck. Not too difficult to remove and we can easily add it back in after our game.
Thanks! Hope you have a great time playing Meadow with your friend.
Thanks very much, I’m hoping so too. He appreciates the theme and he enjoys streamlined games, so I think this will be up his alley.

Where is this meadow suposed to be placed on?: I am really curious about where this meadow is sopuded to be, can someone help me with this please? Thanks!
Do you mean the location of an actual meadow with the sort of species in the game? The species in the base game at least are fairly central European, maybe slightly northeast of centre.
Yes that was the question. Thanks!!
Well, the game was designed and illustrated by Polish people, so that narrows it down a bit, I think.
And during gameplay, we found out that most cards show flora and fauna that can be found in our country too (Serbia, Southeastern Europe), which, from what I am aware of, does not have nature too different than Poland.
So Poland and the surrounding parts of Europe are my best guess for the location of Meadow.

Total card count (base game)?: Hi, I bought the game 2nd hand and trying to do a full component check. But I realised there's 184 cards, plus all the envelopes, which have all already been added into my game. It would've been helpful if they stated how many cards total in these envelopes. Can someone give me the total?
Hi,

some times ago, I have done a excel file for Meadow card list.
You can download it here

To summarize:
180 cards for base game only
+4 cards for start ground
+30 cards from envelops (5 x 6)

Remember: each card has its own reference (Sxx, Axx, Bxx...)

Just a note: I have come to very much appreciate this beautiful game. It is so relaxing, kicks the brain around as you want to invest in that but by the end it is just gold; I feel like I meditated or something (and I can assure I don’t do that ever). 90% of my play of this is solo and it is a bit in that Parks realm, Doctors should prescribe this game.

Like a good number of games, I’m so thankful for the designers and the artists behind them. New games get so much hype, but a game like this that has been around a while and still “gives back” that I have great appreciation for.

FYI in solo I don’t “allow” the trade 2 cards in etc. adds a decent bit of challenge, but I can get my ass handed to me in this game, and without question, I still get the “win” of this gorgeous game.

Doctors should prescribe this game.
Indeed they should! But the prescription would note that you shouldn't play it with 4 if your blood pressure is already too high.

I am impressed by this therapist, he/she may prescribe meds as well, but how nice to see her/him think outside of the box, inside a box that can do wonders for you on so many levels.
Thank you for sharing this

Score sheet available?: Has anyone made a score sheet for the game.

We score several areas separately then total the whole thing. Especially with the expansion.
I use the BGStats android app.

Why do you think the back of the rulebook has an approximate symbol count?: At the last page of the official rulebook, there is a table showing symbol distribution in each deck.
However, it does not show the exact number of symbols, but uses colors to show the approximate number.
For example, Frog symbol is Green (5+ symbols) in deck E, and Orange (3-4 symbols) in deck S.
There is also Red color, which indicates there are 1-2 symbols in a deck.

Is there any real reason why that official table was made with those approximate numbers?
Would it be considered cheating if you had a table with the exact number of symbols?

Probably because they assumed there would be expansions and while the exact numbers wouldn't match, the ratios might.
I initially assumed it was just for simplicity. Meadow is meant to be a fairly light, family game, and while some guidance is helpful, they didn't want the risk of it getting bogged down by card-counting. After all, there is more than enough AP potential in there already...
Besides, what really matters is getting a feel for the differences between the decks, particularly between the South and North decks. E.g., knowing exactly how many flower and fruit cards are in the South deck is less important than knowing there are hardly any in the other decks, so if you haven't got those cards out before the game passes the halfway mark and the South deck disappears, you'll have problems if you need them later...

Thinking about it some more: I haven't counted all the cards myself, but I don't believe the table takes into account any envelopes (not even those included with the base game - the Ungulates aren't listed, for example). It's possible therefore that they wanted to avoid specific numbers, because then they'd have to go into details for every available option. Again: simplicity over precision.
Hi,

I agree this is for simplicity in the official rulebook. The rulebook gives a trend and doesn't drown players with precise statistics.
If you want more precise statistics, I have done an ex... file that shows every cards from base game, expansion and promos, here (you can filter columns and then calculate ratio of each symbol...)
Quote:
Would it be considered cheating if you had a table with the exact number of symbols?
IMHO, that would not if every players have same information.

Envelopes: I think I still have them, need to check though.
I have the following empty envelopes:

N, P, R (a bit torn), T, U, W, X, Y, and Z.
I wonder why there's no V?

Acquiring everything in one go: I have my complete set for Trade on the trade portion of BGG.

You can put some of your things on the list and see if others want what you are done with.

Is it normal for some cards to never show up?: Hey yall!

I recently bought Meadow and yesterday I played my first game with 4 ppl.
Since it was our first time playing it, we played only with 6 rounds (3S + 3N), following the tips from this forum (ty so much!)

We had a great time, but I have a couple of questions:

1. Some cards only appeared a few times, or none at all! Is it normal?
Ex:
Birds of prey never showed up.
Houses appeared only twice, which was kind of bad because it's a pre-requisite for so many other cards. We ended up having to discard 2 cards to drop this requisite most of the times.

2. Is there any way of replacing all market's cards?
Now I know that when the traveler hits the hourglass we are supposed to replace all market by new cards. At our first game we missed it and ended up only replacing S cards for N cards.
But did anyone tried to shuffle all market at the end of a round?
When we set up the marked for the first time, the whole W column had only souvenirs and no landscape. So we had to take some of these even though we could not play it yet, just to empty the slot and release a new card, with the hopes for a landscape to show up.

Thanks in advance. We had a great time! Looking forward to play it again soon
1. This is definitely part of strategizing in the game. The shuffle of the deck determines the rarity. If it bothers you. I suppose you could divide the deck into two parts with equal amounts of card types in each, shuffle them separately, and then stack them on top of each other. This is not per the rules but it helps alleviate your concern.

2. Not that I know of. You have to make choices based on what you see in the market.
Thanks. I guess it makes sense. Knowing what's in the market is definetly a benefit for the first player
It’s very normal solo.
Completely normal. It's what gives the game variety. You need to adapt and go with different strategies depending on what comes out. Also, I think you will find the half way reset of everything does make a big difference.

Having said that, I know some people prefer more variety, and they will house rule wiping a column. For instance, if no one takes anything from a specific one after X number of turns.
@eltonhnjr
Houses appeared only twice, which was kind of bad because it's a pre-requisite for so many other cards. We ended up having to discard 2 cards to drop this requisite most of the times.
Dang - I totally missed that in the rules. I've settled for a lower score on the last play because I was missing a symbol when I could have used the two card discard to get a 4 pointer out !!

Glad I read this thread - thank you !!!

Diameter of the number tokens?: Hello all,

Last weekend I was playing Meadow with my friend. It was his copy and I made the first mistake of accidentally throwing out his block tokens. Then after our first game some of the purple tokens somehow got lost. I have a sneaking suspicion that it's at the bottom of his box under the insert but just to be safe I'm considering asking someone to 3D print replacement tokens. Anyone have the exact diameter of the tokens?

Thanks in advance!

Envelopes O,P,R and N: For those of us who adore your game and played it A LOT (and have therefore already sleeved all the cards), would it be possible to re-release the envelopes O, P, R and N as a whole?
I know you'd like to sell the sleeves, fair enough, but... there are many of us...
Please?
FYI they're available in England, I bought them from there, that's where I discovered there was a pack for Downstream too.
Hi, can you provide a link to where you bought them? Thnx!

Another solo mode in the making: Hey, I made another solo mode similar to campfire variant that is compatible with Downstream expansion, but I would like someone to review and playtest it before posting it here. If someone would like to help me please contact me and I will send you the rules. Thank you

Envelope Reset Guide - How to return cards to their envelopes: I received this game used today, and the cards had not been reset to their envelopes. I searched but did not find anything here on how to reset for a brand new owner, so here is a quick tutorial for other new-comers.

You'll see a "letter - number" mark along the left side of the card, just above the point value (leaf symbol). It corresponds to both the entry in the "Card Index" book and the envelope that card came from, where applicable. The base cards will show A## to D##, while the envelope's cards get T01 to Y06 (matching their envelope letter they belong to). Simply collect those cards out of their piles and put them back in their envelopes to reset (remember, it's 6 cards per envelope).

Happy gaming!
Hi,
I've created an excel file with all known cards (including promo and extensions). This shows where they came from and allows you to reset your game:

Do the 4-point bonus tokens make too much of a difference for 2-player games?: I mainly play this on 2 players with my wife, and have about 5-6 games with or without the Downstream expansion, and one trend that we noticed is whoever gets the 4-point bonus token always wins the game.

This boils down to us having final scores very close to each other (within 7 points), so if the winning player loses the 4-point token and is gained by the losing player, the results would be the opposite. For example, If I scored 70 and my wife 77 (with the 4-point), I would win the game if I had gotten the 4-point (74) vs my wife (73).

We both feel that we were able to score the bonus fairly early on and is mostly dependent on luck/card draws, so in the end it does kind of feel like whoever had the better luck can win the game by scoring the additional 4-point bonus first.

It's not a one-off case but has applied to all of our games with 2 players (w/wo Downstream), so we were wondering if anyone else has been experiencing this and if any house rules can be changed to mitigate this effect, since
I think 4-point bonus is important, but it is not so simple.
In order to win the race for 4-point bonus, you most probably play sub-optimal strategy at some point. In other words you need to sacrifice something (tempo, good card, optimal order of playing cards) to be ahead your oponent. So if your wife won by 7 points (she has 4-point bonus AND maintain good scoring), she deserve to be a winner.
Personally I like this race for bonus and in some of my games player winning 4-point bonus was too greedy, too hasty and sacrificed too much.
If you want to try a houserule, try the reverse order of placing out point tokens.

I tried it a couple times, and thought while the meta is still the same (people rushing to get some symbol matches), the 2-pointer in the end means it's a more diminishing return and people were concerned about optimizing their tableau instead.

Points are still close, and some cases that 2-pointer does matter, but not as big as the point swing like a 4-pointer in the end, so I liked this more than the original rule.
this game is NOT dependent on the luck, considering that my husband and I have played more than 100 times and I NEVER won!! It is becoming a sort of obsession (for me!) and we both don't understand the reason of such result, even when he follows my moves with some suggestion. But my husband is always the one who gets the three damned tokes 2-3-4 and THAT is the difference...

unfair advantage for 1st player at 3-4 player counts: When playing this game with 3-4 players i feel the first player has too much of an advantage. Especially compared to the last player.

The first player has first choice in cards picks with 16 new cards (first turn and half way). With not that many 4 point cards I feel this advantage is substantial.

I think the last player should be compensated with at least an extra card during setup.
There may be a small advantage for the earlier movers, but I'm not sure it is that great - and I feel like an extra card would be too much compensation. Are you playing with the reverse draft at the beginning of the game? That to me is enough. One alternate way to do this would be to let all other players draft one card from every column regardless of row, but then have the first player limited to drafting a row of cards.

Every player gets to be the starting player for an equal number of rounds. Why do you think going first in the first round has more of an advantage than going first in any other round? If anything, I would think going first in the last round is more of an advantage.
Because going first in the round when the N cards enter play is a big advantage. You have first choice when 8 new N cards are played (compared to player which is last in that round).
Valentin
@Orcboss

Considering that it's quite easy to pivot after seeing what the first player is choosing, I don't see it as that large of an advantage. If anything, the later players in the turn have more information and can choose what to do accordingly.

What I have found with Meadow is that there's more of a points-per-action economy. A 4 pt card is not a huge advantage over a 3 pt card. So the real question is whether players are generating (on average) 2 pts/turn or 3 pts/turn. You can easily test this out by playing a game with only 1 player. Using your own selection tokens and the campfire board with no one blocking, try to see what is the most points you can generate. The whole game would be 32 turns and with exceptional scores in the upper 60s/low 70s, you should be aiming to score 2 pts or 3 pts for every turn.

When playing on the side of the board with only 6 rounds, you get 30 turns, so a little bit less. Someone else please correct me if I'm missing something.
I would say that one can't generalize on this, as it really depends on which cards are revealed. Sometimes, when there is only one card with a certain icon which everyone requires, e.g. a certain landscape card, or later in the game one of the rarer predators, etc. the benefit of being able to choose first is indeeed immense.
On other occassions, the player to go last may profit from having a better overview in planning their strategy if only there is a more even distribution of card types and icons.

Thus, the problem described by Valentin does exist, but it is connected to the general randomness of when and what kind of cards will appear. Any attempt to fix this would have to deal with how the luck factor affects balancing, not necessarily with the player order.

You are right its an action/point economy. But you are wrong stating that by being able to get a 4 point card over a 3 point card isnt an advantage. Thats a 25% gain (if both can be played)

If all cards were perfectly balanced and there were unlimited spots on the board to put action tokens the last player would have an advantage. But thats not the case. Some cards are significantly better and spots are limited.

Limited spaces:

Biggest impact is on the last action of a given round where the last player has significant less options. For instance being stuck with a 4/play 2 cards action while he cannot play 2 actions or all 4th cards do not match his meadow. In this case the last player is sometimes already "forced" to play "sub optimal" in round 3 because otherwise his round 4 would be completely wasted. Ofc the optimal for him would be to play sub optimal in round 3 in order to max his points in round 3+4.

Better cards:

Consisider this scenario. Suppose the N deck contains 1 card that costs nothing to play and is worth 100 points.

Does the first player now has an unfair advantage or not?

According to my manual, you do not pick cards halfway, before the table's purge.

Any one have a spare set of the S/E deck?: Just opened my copy and was excited to play until I realized I’ve got two N/W decks and no S/E cards. Bought my copy at target and they are sold out and unable to provide me with a replacement copy unfortunately and it looks like the publisher doesn’t do replacement parts so I’m feeling a bit down about it now. Figured maybe someone out there had the opposite problem or might have a damaged copy that they’d be willing to part out, so here I am.

Have you actually contacted Rebel? They have been responsive with regards to replacement parts in the past...
 
I have never had a problem getting replacement parts from the publisher. They even sent me a set of promo cards for just a small shipping fee when I asked them about it a year ago. Definitely reach out to them.
It might be best to get a refund from Target and then picking it up from your local FLGS, an online retailer, Barnes and Noble, or right here on the BGG marketplace.

Looks like Asmodee is going to help me out! Thank you for the posts and super excited to play once I’ve got all the components!

Will there ever be a second expansion?: Title. I loved Meadow even before Downstream came out and that has made it a favourite in our gaming groups.

The problem is that it is a table hog, so I don't know what a second expansion could do. Maybe some asymmetric starting cars / powers / player boards? Some sort of Legendary animals you could get if you have specific and difficult collection of symbols on your tableau?

Would you guys be interested in a new expansion? What do you feel like it should add?
Think that was discussed a bit here.

I made Achievements for Meadow: I while ago, I realized I'm much more interested in playing games solo, if there is a goal. Either beating a bot or at least a target number of points or something. I don't like a simple highscore hunt. And I wanted to bring meadow more often to the table. A quick research showed, that other people might be interested too, so I made some Achievements for Meadow.
You can find them here:
Meadow Achievments

I also made a german version:
Meadow Errungenschaften

I hope you'll appreciate these and have fun with them.

P.S. I hope it's okay to post this not under variants, because it's not really a variant. They don't change the game, they just give incentives to play a certain way or strategy.
I don’t play solo much, but these are pretty cool. Nice work!

I have a question about mono culture meadow, does that mean there shouldn’t be any other symbols? Thanks for sharing, good job!
There can be other symbols.
@Angelcollector
There can be other symbols.
Got it in this case - done.
Thanks for this, I'll definitely try these. Regarding 'Patience pays off' which is achieved if I place all 3 bonus tokens in the same round. I don't think this is a legal move, see page 13 of the rulebook:
Quote:
During your turn, you can place only 1 bonus token on the campfire board even if you have more symbols that fulfil several goals.

That's why the achievement says "round", not turn. You have 5 (or 6 with Downstream) turns in a round.
Ohh, my bad, I missed that

Meadow print error no 3-4 player board: Hello, I just received a copy of Meadow as a gift, but when I opened it, I saw that I don’t have the campfire board for 3-4 players. Instead, I have two campfire boards for 1-2 players. What can I do? I tried to contact Rebel customer service at sklep@rebel.pl, but received no answer. I can’t return the copy to the store because I’m in Romania and the game was purchased by the person who gifted me the game from another country.
Give them a few days. They may be getting back from Spiel Essen.
they did write me now but no luck...
"Hello,
Thank you for the message. Please contact the store where the purchase was made or the game distributor in your country." how can i know what distributor is in ROmania for Meadow?
Ask the game store where you bought it which distributor they purchase their games from (specifically for Meadow). They may buy from a couple of distributors but only one would be selling them Meadow.
i cant. i didnt buy it. Its a gift for my birthday and the person buyed from a sale house outside my country.

i contact them and they say that they will replace/or delivery only for the RO version of Meadow and not ENG version, but the game is independent of language. They did say that will speak with the deposits and maybe find a way. I'm waiting to see if they can replace the board only.

Games like Meadow for Solo play: This game is such a satisfying puzzle. I like how it feels relaxing but challenging at the same time. In terms of mechanics and gameplay, which similar games could you recommend?
I would recommend Cascadia and Verdant.
Cascadia and Evergreen
Thank you both! I like Cascadia, although I find it much lighter and more abstract than Meadow. I will check Verdant and Evergreen.
So, I've played a digital demo version of Verdant, and I think I prefer it to Cascadia now. Great game. It reminds me of Overboss, the exact mechanism of picking a pair of a tile and a token, placing them on a grid, and working towards many scoring objectives. They all fall in the same category: Cascadia, Verdant, Overboss, and Calico (well, Calico, I haven't played yet, but now I'm interested and might try the demo). Meadow... is not in that category
Edit: So I am still on the hunt for a game that will give me the same vibe as Meadow!

I haven't played Wingspan solo, but for me these 2 games are very similar low contact, solitary-kind with beautiful art.

It has an excellent solo bot by Automa factory and a beautiful art indeed! Pretty tough opponent that bot is.
You'll probably also love Keystone: North America. Beautiful animal artwork, relaxing puzzle and a bunch of scenarios with various objectives to work your way through
Thank you for recommendation, Nona!

availability of promos: hello! does anyone know if there’s any future plan to make the promotional things more accessible? i just ordered meadow along with the expansion and meadow cards and sleeves pack, and realised there’s many more promo things to get but nothing seems to be available (i live in greece) and i always have this need to complete a collection if the game has a lot of content so does anyone know?
The Meadow promo cards are available through the BGG Store:
https://boardgamegeekstore.com/search?q=meadow
i know about that, but it doesn't have all the envelopes plus for me in greece the shipping costs more than the actual cards all together so it's rlly not worth paying 22€ for 3 small cards

Thank you, that is great to hear. I pestered my FLGS about this promos constantly and shamelessly

Hi Joanna, I was wondering whether there are any updates on the availability of promo cards in Europe. I would absolutely love to get my hands on that robin card; it is so adorable!
As for Robin - it was first print only promo, so we are not planning to reprint it. And for other promos, we are still fighting for better availability in Europe and we hope this will be solved faster then later
Thank you for the quick response (and the amazing game you and everyone at Rebel developed)! Than I'll definitely look for the robin around here on BGG. I cannot wait for Adventure Book with even more amazing artwork by Karolina Kijak!
Only promo left available on BGG is the Seal at the moment. Robin and Bigfoot are sold out.

Can't stop pimping My Meadow: Adore this game and expansion so competitive never more than a handful of points between us.
Made these player mats (thanks costa coffee don't tell them) keeps the columns from mixing
Nice. I think I want to do the same. Such a nice game deserves to look tidy.
Is there any way that you could upload the files?
will try
Very nice. If I don't have the skills or funds I will continue to obsessively straighten rows with a sideways card. Just like Carcassonne!
Hi,

I dunno, I recommend stopping pimping your game. Now blinging or upgrading would be nice
Did you create an alternative for the blocking tokens? My copy is missing one and I was trying to think of something creative that I could replace it with rather than just do a hap hazard one by cutting out of punch board.
I just use path tokens from one of the players not in use. Turn them over if you prefer.

Language independent?: I can't spot any text in any pictures of the game (cards&board). Is that correct? Are all components language independent?
Is it the same for downstream expansion?

I don't mind the rule booking being in another language.

Thanks for your help!

Official Name for Each Symbol?: I just bought the game Meadow yesterday and not yet played.
Have read the rules and looked online but couldn't find an answer...maybe I missed it.

Is there an official name for each of the (15?) symbols?

I know it's not terribly important... and you can call them whatever you like.
... but is it slugs or worms or caterpillars? ...paws or claws or critters? etc...
Thanks
Yes, there are

Promo Card Disappointment: I don't try to complete collections for every game, but I have been trying to complete my Meadow collection. I absolutely adore this game easily makes my top 10 if not top 5. I thought I had completed the collection after paying 20 bucks for the Dice Tower Seal promo and was so excited. Then when doing my research realized I had missed Envelope O. I don't even know when/how this was available. I guess I'll never complete my Meadow collection. This has been a nightmare to collect for and not very cheap. Easily have sunk a good 150 dollars into getting what I have so far. If anyone can lead me in the direction of getting the elusive promo item, please let me know.
Patience will help.
Fair enough!

I am in the same boat. I am still waiting for the Seal card, the expansion sleeves, and also just found out about Envelope O. As Murr said, just be patient. When I received most of the previous promos, it was just waiting it out to have BGG and other places have it in stock on this side of the pond so I didn't have to pay crazy money.
Expansion sleeves available on 401 games and Board Game Bliss! Not sure if they ship to the US, but if they do it would be pretty cheap seeing as it's in Canadian dollars. Cheers!

Same here, still waiting for the Seal Card promo to be available somehow to purchase. Also completely missed the Envelope O as there was not any info about it anywhere, even here in Poland. I found out about Envelope O by accident here on BGG. Hope to get it some day.
Also completely missed Envelope O. And really want to add it to my meadow collection. Same goes for my sagrada collection.

Add me to the list of people that is, at this point, exasperated at the seemingly impossible mission of buying promos. Not just for this, but most games. I'm quickly arriving at the stage where I'll entirely pass on a game that makes buying promos for it so difficult.

Meadow Envelope O: I just noticed this entry Meadow: Envelope O under expansions. It says 2021, but little other details. What does it contain, does anybody know? I have almost every promo for this game and the Downstream expansion, but not this one. It's the first time I heard about it and I am very curious.
Thank you in advance for any help.

Hi, Joanna, thank you for looking out for us. I already let me FLGS know about this promo, hope we can get it here in Romania as well. Can't wait for more gorgeous illustrations.
Couldn't agree more!
I really hope, this will be availble soon. If there is someone who is looking or willing to sell their copy, please send me a private message.
Just curious... did anyone had the luck of finding a copy?
Any update on when this will be available?

What is the longest possible sequence?: I was wondering what the longest possible sequence for this game is. For example, a grass, topped by a caterpillar, topped by a bird, topped by a fence is a sequence with length 4.
I imagine that the sequence can be much longer, because some cards only require certain ground symbols, so you can start again with a low level card.

Just try to puzzle it out!
Have fun

Sleeved cards difficult to pick off the board: This may be a non-issue for most, but after sleeving the cards with those from Meadow's Cards & Sleeves pack, I noticed I was having trouble picking off the cards from the main board- especially the four central ones. I tend to sleeve my cards with the open end on top, but after some "experimenting" I found they're much easier to grab off the board with the closed end on top.

Again, this may be specific to me, but if someone's having similar "struggles" it may help sleeving them with the open end at the bottom!
I've noticed that too! Interesting thought about reversing the sleeves...might have to give it a try.

Resin campfire for Meadow available at Michael's (US hobby store): Hi folks! I was browsing in Michael's the other day (Michael's is a US hobby store, not sure they're in other countries or not) and found this:

https://www.michaels.com/product/mini-campfire-by-ashland-10...

When I saw it, I immediately thought that it would look great on my Meadow game board, and it does!



In the stores around my area this is on clearance for only $3.
This is great, thanks for posting. It would work in a number of games in my collection and we have a Michael's about 10 minutes away.
You're quite welcome! I also got a miniature coffee cup for Ark Nova at the same location.

It looks great, THANK YOU.
Thanks for the tip Dave. Checked three nearby stores and finally found the last one in our county. It looks like it was made for Meadow. Great find!

New Expension?: Hey, i've heard about a "legacy" expension. Something like a book?

Do we have some news about it?
(It will be the only legacy i want to play so i'm really curious )

Édit for corrections
Hi,

The only news I know are here:
The Meadow Adventure Book is a scenario-based expansion for Meadow. Each page of the adventure book introduces new rules that will alter the way the game is played, in almost a "Legacy-style" manner. Meadow Adventure Book is scheduled to be released in 2023.

Perhaps, Asia_Rebel can give more details if she is around
Oooooh, that's nice!! If there's a French version, I'm in, because Meadows is a really good game!
Thanks a lot for this @Bobraz38

It's funny, my daughter and I just played this and had the exact same thought!

Tighter than expected: We found this to be a far tighter game than the 'stroll through a meadow' vibe it gives off at first glance.

Most times I had very few options for card choices that made sense. It feels like there are too many symbol categories for the amount of cards you see. For example, we had plenty of cards that required berries, but only one card show up the whole game that actually was a berry. Multiple cards required fences, but zero fence cards. Many required houses, I think two showed up. The wolf/predator never came up at all, but was on the campfire board, being useless at giving bonuses.

Because of this it didn't feel like we were making meaningful choices. If there is only one card out of 16 that is even remotely useful to me, that isn't fun, I just have to take that card.

The special action of looking at three cards and choosing one was unsatisfying as often you'd have a selection of three cards that didn't help you in any way.

We may have to house-rule more card churn somehow. Give the '?' special action an optional 'replace all cards in any row or column' action, for example, or draw a card or two at the beginning of each round.

Anybody else feel this or are we missing something in the gameplay? I'm used to other tight games like Agricola, not that I'm comparing them, but that I'm okay with it. Not sure I'm okay with it in a card game where you only see a fraction of the cards in any particular game. Wingspan is similar but gives you more options for drawing cards, so you can always, if you like, end up with a large hand size to play from.
Be sure to use the campfire action of drawing three cards and pick one from any deck to delve deeper for what you need. Also, remember that you can discard any two cards to bypass a required icon. Learn which icons you should not cover up that quickly, especially when your top cards are top of the food chain animals that have little to no predators. If the animals are not cutting it out, build roads, get landscapes on them and discoveries on the landscapes, that will bring out more cards with homes and fences.

The Meadow downstream expansion offers more cards and extra actions, but if you don’t like the base game, it might just not be your type of game.

Yes, to confirm, this game has tight choices, and potential for cutthroat moves from your opponent that deny you actions. The scores are usually close though, because it will be a struggle for both players. I don’t think is just random, just full of tactical choices and some playing-the-odds.
Quite often you have to lay more ground cards to to exploit the cards on the board. You can discard cards, to ignore symbols you don't have. Sometimes some of the campfire bonuses just don't work out . You can use the campfire action to draw 3 from the deck and chose one. I've never played with less than 3 players though, I can see that 2 players would provide less card changes between goes. Someone always takes the card you want though provoking cries of anguish. Brilliant game, throughly evil,rather than a pleasant walk through the countryside.

I have only played the game at 3-4 players and I think it shines at those counts (and I find it best at 3 due to the extra "wild card" action), but there are multiple threads complaining of not seeing enough cards in the 2 player game - and I can believe it. If that is OP's concern, then I suggest looking at the threads with variants for more card churn in the 2 player game.

@okami31
Be sure to use the campfire action of drawing three cards and pick one from any deck to delve deeper for what you need.
As I mentioned, this is often unhelpful as we're faced with three bad choices and doesn't feel like a good option.

And we've never played with more than 2, so perhaps getting at least one more player would help us, as the other responses seem to indicate. With 2p it's just not enough and I think we'll try a few gentle house rules to create more card turnover.

Thanks all for your comments so far.

I understand that none of the three cards can seem a good option, but remember a card is a card and can be used as a discard with another card to help complete a series of symbols you don't have. I really use that very often. In that way, Meadow looks a bit like Terraforming Mars or Everdell, where the use of cards is circumstancial (sorry if it's not the right word, I'm not a native english speaker) and you have to adapt your strategy on the go.
Right on the money. That was exactly our experience as well.
Oops I just read all the following comments. Very helpful. Thanks

Advice to new Meadow owners. Don't open the envelopes!: Some folks have said just open the envelopes and mix them all in. We have really enjoyed opening the envelopes slowly over time as suggested by the rulebook. It is a lot of fun getting new cards occasionally. It keeps Meadow fresh.
I agree. I don't understand why anyone would open all of the envelopes and immediately mix all of the cards in on their first play. It completely defeats the whole point of their existence.
Rob Bell
@DrCrow
I agree. I don't understand why anyone would open all of the envelopes and immediately mix all of the cards in on their first play. It completely defeats the whole point of their existence.
I would agree with that, but I'm also not looking to slow drip the cards over the course of a year or more. After our second game I opened an envelope, after the third another, and then after the fifth they all were opened. There is an expansion now as well, with other envelopes, plus there were promo envelopes - at some point I just want to play with everything (and then decide if that actually works or if some stuff needs to be removed - I'm not sure the game benefits from all of those extra cards being used every game)
I did open all of them at once so I could get the full experience of the game. I’m not only playing it but also evaluating it to see if it’s worth keeping it in my collection. I wouldn’t want to risk considering it too light by not including all of its components.

I also got the Downstream expansion after one play of the base game, and the decision space is so rich now when mulling over which cards to take. We played it again the next day because of how fun it was.

So, to each their own, but for me, I tend to want all of the game from the get-go, especially if the game is not a heavier one like say Ark Nova (I have only played in the basic zoo map with new players).
It's just a gimmick isn't it? Opening the envelopes straight away doesn't make me a bad person, does it?

Of course not. You do you!

I just don't understand it, is all. You can call it a "gimmick" if you like, but the cards were put in those envelopes for a reason.

I think that reason may be more to do with jumping on the design bandwagon of Gloomhaven and the like than anything else.

To me it is simply a waste of paper to arbitrarily envelope a card in a medium weight game. iirc the cards are not that drastically different to warrant the separation.

I say, if you're a seasoned gamer, tear all the envelopes open on game 1 and treat yourself to the full experience

Hello! I recently received Meadow in a trade. It looks like the lettered envelopes are already opened and in the game since I don’t see them.

Do you know of the content in the envelopes because I would like to recreate them for my 3rd grade daughter? Thank you all so much as I want to surprise her.
If you look at the expansions for Meadow they have images of the contents of each envelope. There are also other promos in the BGG store.

Where the cards have numbers (along the left edge near the bottom), they should have a Letter prefacing that with their corresponding Envelope letter. So P cards should be P01-P08.

Meadow restock dates?: Hello, is anyone aware of when the next round of meadow games will be made available? Boadgamebliss ( a Canadian FLGS) has them up for preorder but can't seem to find anywhere when the game will be out. Thanks!
I don't know the answer to your question, but I just bought Meadow the other day from a local store:

I didn't think it was a hard game to find these days, but maybe it is.

It's in stock at Board Game Bliss, they are a Canadian retailer but I find their shipping to be very reasonable and they have free shipping options if the order is large enough. They also have a much wider selection of games than most American online retailers lately as well.

Average 2 player playing time?: After you have a few games under your belt, about how long does a two player game take?

Hi Dean, two of us play Meadow in 45 minutes approximately.
Yup, sounds about right!
30-45 minutes
The game will be under the christmas tree for us to play. This length sounds perfect. I can't wait !
Us also. I am going to buy the expansion too.
We take about an hour or just over that to play our two-player games - my 15 year old daughter and myself.

Cards and Sleeves Pack: I've been waiting and looking for cards and sleeves pack since last year but the availability in Asia region is none or out of supply in any websites. Will there be a reprint for this or any plan to sell the R envelope only in the future?

Also curious on this one. It's sold out everywhere in Canada. I see that there is a new version releasing but it appears to only be for the Downstream expansion.

Card Sleeves: For those interested in sleeving the cards to extend their life, these sleeves work great and you only need 2 packs. The game has 214 cards. Each pack has 110, so you’ll have 6 leftovers. The sleeved cards fit fine in the game’s insert, so there’s no problem there.

Amazon: Sleeve Kings Sails of Glory Card Sleeves (50x75mm) - 110 Pack, 60 Microns

I bought mine from Atomic Empire. I added them to a another shipment to get free shipping, but they are now sold out.

Miniature Market has them, but there are only only 5 left as I type this.

If you do want them, I would suggest not procrastinating. I would also not recommend thicker premium sleeves, or they might not fit in the game’s insert. Even with these thin sleeves, the cards extend to near the top of the game’s card trays.
This works for a lot of games

1. Go to the main page of the game
2. Scroll down to the bottom
3. Click "See All" in the Geeklists with this Game section
4. Sort by "Hot"
5. The "Card Sleeves Sizes for Games" will almost always sort to the top if the game is included in it.
6. Click the link

You might also post there your discovery of an alternate sleeve for the game.

I don’t have the Downstream expansion. Even more cards? Houston, we might have a problem.

Already getting a bit crowded, and this doesn’t even include the extra cards in the sealed envelopes.
It’s not out yet in NA. There are more cards but there’s also a new card holder, no worries.

Only necessary if you want to protect the beautiful artwork on each card.

Hi Joshua, thanks for the question! The T-shirts were created as an promo item for our team (we wear them on the events) and there was a chance to get it in BGG contest when the game was released. We decided to gift one to Camilla as we know she is an extreme Meadow fan
So sadly right now there is no option to get the shirt, but thank you for the interest, we noted that!
Maybe those Meadow wallpapers will help a little bit
Thank you for the reply and I totally understand.
Figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask.
The wallpaper collection is much appreciated.

Will I like this if I disliked Parks?: Amongst the many glowing reviews of this game, I see quite a few reviews mentioning that they feel this is more of an activity than a game...

I had the same feeling for Parks and sold it after just three plays. I also had the same feelings towards Canvas, which I only played once and never want to entertain again... I thought far more positively about Cascadia, only moving it on after ~20 plays.

I'd welcome your thoughts on whether it might be best I avoid this. I'll not get to try it before I buy as no one in my game group has it, so it's all in or nothing.

Mechanically, none of these feel alike to me. I also don't know that "more of an activity than a game" is true for any of these. True, none of them are heavyweights in terms of strategy or brain-burning level, but that's not required for a game to be a game.

Also, Meadow is available on Tabletopia, including the solo mode, so you can give it a shot there.
So I love PARKS (but primarily with the   Expansion) and i'm just ok on Meadow. I don't think they're terribly similar, but if you felt that PARKS was too simplistic, I think you may want to pass on Meadow. In PARKS, the only real interaction between players is blocking them from a spot. In Meadow, the same issue is at play.

The art is gorgeous, but lots of games have beautiful art these days. I love the theme, but there are plenty of games with nature themes! Looking at your current collection, I think the issue is that you're looking for more player interaction than either of these games offer.

So I would recommend you instead take a look at  , the newer-than-Evolution  , or the upcoming   (all 3 from Northstar games). For even broader applications of the nature theme, you may be interested in   or   (or any of the Bios games, really). These are incredibly interactive games with far more scheming and plotting and getting in each other's way.

I find Meadow to be much more interactive than you, unless you are only using the term to mean direct conflict. Since cards don't have to be played when collected, defense can be used to take cards that would obviously help your foe. There is a race aspect to some bonuses that creates interaction. Plus the Downstream expansion creates another race. I also feel like there is just as much complexity if not more in the base game of Meadow compared to the base of Parks.
I played Meadow solo yesterday - first play of the game - and must confess that I did think of PARKS… but only that in both games you are wandering/walking/hiking and sightseeing/spotting wildlife/flora…so more the theme than the mechanics.
Neither game is similar. I can’t really think of another game that plays like Meadow. When you first play it you won’t really get the strategy. But after repeated plays I found it grew on me. Obviously there is a fair amount of interaction as you want to be the first to score things. There are only 3 opportunities to score 9 points so the four player will only score 5 points. So you are looking at others boards working out what you can score. The scoring tight and in a small range so it really will come down to the winner having a couple a more high scoring cards. It’s also quite strategic in that you have to build a base in order to be able to score well in the later rounds.

I agree with this, Meadow is much more interactive at least at higher player counts than Parks. I am looking forward to the Downstream expansion though because I think base Meadow could use a bit more complexity and maybe another scoring category. I sold my copy of Parks after just a few plays, but I plan to keep Meadow in my collection - hope that helps!

Block tokens suggestion: I believe that 1 and 2 person games require 2 block tokens. So why not have two fewer cutouts on the board? (The block tokens feel chinzy.)

You respond, "Because two different boards would have driven up the production costs".

So I say, give me an extra block token. I'll glue the other two block tokens into the 1-2 player board. (I'm never going to play with 3 anyways.)

Have played the game twice and it's great!

Rebel thinks, hmmm, this guy would buy an expansion that consist of a single block token

Thanks for the suggestion! You are right that the way the campfire board looks is because of the production process simplification. It's always some kind of compromise to produce the game in desired quality and price range.
In terms of extra block tokens - I think there is a great opportunity for DIY here using what's left from punchboard

Why so pricey?: I've heard great things about this and watched a video and it looked really fun.
I've been wanting another shorter /lighter (at least in set up and components) game and this looks right up my alley.
But its priced between £35 and £40 in retailers here in UK. It's not a heavyweight game with lots of components yet it's almost priced like it- I was expecting a price tag more around £25. Anyone know why this is?
I'm going to have to hold pat on picking this up at that price tag- as good as the gameplay appears the contents aren't worth that high price tag.
The components are amazing quality and the variety of art for the cards is unbelievable. Honestly, having owned a copy for almost a year now, I think a higher price tag could have been warranted. Sadly, with rising costs for all base materials, it seems rare to even find most CARD games for less than $20-25USD anymore let alone a game with gorgeous art (different for every single card), great card trays, an insert, etc. Hope you give it a shot and I hope to hear back with good results!
It has about 200 cards. So similar number to   or  . Screen printed round tracker. Promo envelopes to open. Two double sided board with cut outs. The card holders which hold the decks are really nice and the insert is well designed. It’s actually a bit of a bargain.
A bargain in every way and not a light game at all.
You are just flat-out wrong about the components; this game is worth every penny they are charging for it.
It looks GORGEOUS on the table.
This game is among the best you will experience. The gameplay and the artwork are extremely top notch. I would easily pay double if thats what they asked. Anxiously awaiting the expansion as well. You will not regret getting this, just go for it!
The publisher's costs were likely higher due to the amount of commissioned artwork in the game -- there is a lot of unique art, and they had to pay for it all, and still make money on the product.

As many others have said, Meadow represents excellent value.

Also... when were heavyweight games £35? Agricola was £50 when I bought it back in 2012. Heavyweight games have been £60-£80+ for several years now.

Exactly this, almost every card has unique and fantastic fully painted artwork. The component quality is amazing and I think the game is a great value at that price.
It was £30 from Zatu (who usually are very competitive) May 2021 - since then everything has gone up in price as I'm sure you've noticed. To be honest at £40 it's worth every penny- excellent components, fantastic insert that work so well (even with sleeved cards), great relaxing gameplay which although is straight forward is still puzzley enough for AP and some beautiful artwork.
This is one game I love to play again and again- one of my best buys and one I'll certainly always keep.
This is a relatively cheap game within the hobby gaming field for the amount of art and components you get.

Not sure. I think I've only ever played it at 4 and enjoy it. Perhaps just that "your card" you want to draft might not be available before it comes back around to you, or too many tags blocking the row/column you want dampens the effect. I guess I need to try this with less and see what makes it so much better.

I believe the reason is because the game is just tighter and less forgiving at 4 players. The extra "wild card" action token that each player receives in a 2 or 3 player game is not used with 4.

I have played at all player counts now, and while I enjoy the game at both 2 and 4 players I think it is best at 3. That said, the expansion may change things. I am always happy to play Meadow though, love the game, theme and artwork - it is a near perfect light to medium weight Euro that plays in 1.5 hours or less.
Some have noted that the game is too long at 4 players (I agree). If I remember correctly, simply skipping the first & last round on the round tracker is an easy fix (6 rounds vs 8 rounds).

The game should not last all that much longer at 4 players than at 3 though due to the smaller number of actions per player in each round. I wonder if some people complaining of the game being too long are still playing with all five action markers at the 4 player count? I suppose 6 rounds could work, but I would feel that is not enough time to build synergies and really experience the N deck cards.
I have played Meadow several times at 4 players. It's bit longer but actually more fun.
I played the first time with the normal 8 rounds (which felt too long) and subsequent games using the 6-round variant. It still felt like plenty of game and plenty of time to develop synergies. I recommend trying it at least once.
When you reduce the number of rounds to six you take away two player's "first player" turns, right? Any negative effect on those players that you have noticed?
Not really - there's usually several good options and players are frequently pursuing their own goals.

Brian, the game is definitely longer when playing with 4 :

2P : 5 actions per round * 6 rounds * 2 players = 60 actions in total
3P : 5 actions per round * 6 rounds * 3 players = 90 actions in total
4P : 4 actions per round * 8 rounds * 4 players = 128 actions in total

No doubt, it is certainly longer - but not all that much longer in my opinion. An action in this game takes at most one minute and often times much less I would think. I'm not of the opinion that adding 20-30 min to the game at most is that big of a deal, but I guess for some it is. I prefer the game at 3 players not because of the time, but due to the added control of the wildcard action.

So far, I've kept out of this discussion (here and on other threads), but this alludes to another issue besides duration that has largely been ignored: the game subtly changes depending on player count.

The main change from 3 to 4 players is obvious: as stated above, you lose the wildcard tokens at 4-player. However there's also an extra token overall played per round (16 instead of 15 at 3-player), so as the main board fills up, the minimum number of tokens that must be placed on the campfire board instead will be higher.

The change in gameplay between 2 and 3 players is more subtle, but still important. With only 10 tokens to be played in total each round at 2-player, the main board will never fill up. Now, it's still possible that you may not have a valid placement on the main board, but with a little planning - and those wildcard tokens - it shouldn't happen much. It's therefore quite possible to have a round at 2-player where neither player uses the campfire board, and certainly isn't forced to. Note that I'm not saying this necessarily represents "best play": just that it's possible, and I would suggest this is a factor in the more relaxed feel of 2-player games...

I tried to get promos at Essen but everywhere I tried I was told they didn't have them and they weren't available anywhere.
Hopefully I can get some at UKGE this year then.
Sorry to hear that! Try at our booth - the shops rarely carry all the promos

I did think I was at your booth according to the app map but maybe I wasn't or there was some miscommunication - I'll hopefully get them eventually
